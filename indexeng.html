              AS YOU CAN SEE IN THIS GRAPHIC OF VEHICULAR INSOLATION DEATHS FROM 1998 UNTIL 2021 THE GRAPHIC ONLY CONTINUES TO INCREASE, WHAT BIGGES US MORE OF ALL THIS IS THAT IN THE YEAR 2019 THE YEAR OF THE SARS-CoV-2 PANDEMIC or BETTER KNOWN AS COVID 19; LET'S REMEMBER THAT AT THE END OF 2019 AND BEGINNING OF 2020 THE WORLD WILL BE PARALYZED ALL COUNTRIES CLOSED 
              BORDERS AND WE ISOLATED OURSELVES FROM THE WORLD IN GENERAL. WELL DURING THOSE 2 YEARS OF PANDEMIC THERE WERE AROUND 50 DEATHS DUE TO VEHICULAR HEAT STROKE. WITH THAT ALONE WE UNDERSTOOD THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG. AND IT DOESN'T STOP THERE, REMEMBER! THIS GRAPH IS ONLY DATA OF DEATHS BUT THERE IS NO DATA OF COLLATERAL DAMAGE FOR BEING IN THAT TYPE OF SITUATION BUT WE DO KNOW THAT IT COULD HAPPEN IF A BABY IS FORGOTTEN. 
              COULD HAPPEN IF A BABY IS FORGOTTEN IN THIS TYPE OF CONDITIONS.

              <p class="member0">
                THIS PROJECT BECAME KNOWN WHEN OUR TEACHER MET WITH MY CLASSMATE JOSE CARLOS TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT, THESE ARE THE CASES OF CHILD DEATH IN VEHICLES DUE TO HEATSTROKE. WHICH IN SHORTER WORDS MEANS THAT IT HAPPENS WHEN A CHILD IS LOCKED IN THE CAR FOR ANY REASON AND SUFFERS FROM THE HIGH TEMPERATURES THAT ARE GENERATED UNTIL HE LOSES HIS LIFE.

              <p class="member0">
                SO WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF SOLVING IT WITH A PROJECT, SO WE GOT DOWN TO WORK AND BEGAN TO FOLLOW AN INVESTIGATION ON THE CASES THAT OCCURRED, HOW THEY OCCURRED, AND HOW THEY AFFECTED. WE WERE SURPRISED BY THE STATISTICS TO DISCOVER THAT THEY WERE VERY FREQUENT CASES, SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN WE INVESTIGATED AND QUESTIONED SOME OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS CONFESSED THAT I WAS A VICTIM OF THIS TYPE OF SITUATION, EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE FINE AT THE TIME OF CREATING THIS WEBSITE.

              <p class="member0">
                ANOTHER THING THAT WAS UNVEILED FROM ALL THIS RESEARCH THAT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO FORMULATE A SOLUTION FOR THIS, WAS THAT THE ONLY STATISTICS THAT THERE WERE FOR THIS TYPE OF CASES QUANTIFIED THE DEATHS ONLY BUT IN NO OTHER TYPE OF DATA OR GRAPHS SHOWED THOSE AFFECTED BY SUFFERING THIS TYPE OF SITUATIONS, BECAUSE IF THEY SURVIVE THEY CAN SUFFER MANY MORE CONSEQUENCES AND WITH AN ACT AS SIMPLE AND APPARENTLY BANAL AS LEAVING YOUR CHILDREN IN A CONSCIOUS OR NEGLIGENT WAY FOR A MOMENT IN THE CAR. MANY OF US BELIEVE THAT SUCH A SITUATION COULD HAPPEN, BUT IT MAY BE MORE COMMON THAN YOU THINK.
